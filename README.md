This detailed documentation outlines the DriverPass system, a system that lets customers purchase and reserve custom driving lesson packages through an easy to use application.
I have provided diagrams and different models that represent the flow of activites within the system as well as the relationships between different entities within the system.

These tools and practies helped me further understand the analysis and design behind the development of different software systems and provided me with the skills necessary to implement these designs.
